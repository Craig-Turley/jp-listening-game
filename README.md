# JP Listening Game!

Select which type of listening you want to work on from the main menu. Each listening practice starts with clicking the speaker icon, 
and typing what you believe the answer to be. For both dates and times, single digit numbers (1-9) require a leading 0. For example,
if I wanted to type 9 o'clock, this would be 09:00 and for the first of the month it would be noted as 01. Please feel free to submit
any bugs you find via the github issues panel.
